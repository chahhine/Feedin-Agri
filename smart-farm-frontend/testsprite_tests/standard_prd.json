  },
  "product_overview": "Smart Farm Management System is a next-generation web application designed to empower farmers and administrators to monitor, control, and optimize agricultural operations through IoT-driven data, real-time dashboards, automation, and analytics within a modern, user-friendly interface supporting multiple languages and responsive design.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide farmers with real-time, actionable insights for farm management using IoT sensor data and device control.",
    "Enable administrators to oversee and manage users, devices, farms, and global system performance effectively.",
    "Deliver a highly usable and accessible system with advanced notifications, role-based access, and personalized profiles.",
    "Implement seamless multi-language support with responsive dark/light themes for inclusive user experience.",
    "Ensure high performance, security, and test readiness with modern web technologies and architectural best practices."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "JWT-based authentication with role-based access control for secure login and user management.",
    "Real-time dashboard with sensor data visualization, device status, and quick action floating button.",
    "Comprehensive farm, device, and sensor management modules with search, filtering, bulk operations, and export capabilities.",
    "Action center providing manual control of equipment, real-time action streams, and detailed action histories.",
    "Notification system delivering categorized real-time alerts with WebSocket support and alert dialogs.",
    "Multi-language support (English, Arabic, French) with right-to-left layout support and smooth language transitions.",
    "Dark and light theme toggling with eco-futuristic glassmorphism design and soft neumorphism UI.",
    "Shared UI components for consistent experience including headers, footers, language switcher, loading screens, and custom dropdowns.",
    "Advanced tooltips and dropdowns positioning using Floating UI library for improved usability.",
    "RESTful API integration with interceptors for authentication, error handling, and global services."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in or registers with JWT-based authentication and is directed to their respective dashboard (Farmer or Admin) based on role.",
    "Farmers access their dashboard to view real-time data from IoT devices, sensor readings, and farm maps; they can perform manual control actions and monitor recent activities.",
    "Administrators navigate global dashboards to manage users, farms, and devices, and generate performance reports with role-based access restrictions.",
    "Users receive real-time notifications with options to read, delete, or mark them as read and configure notification preferences in settings.",
    "Users can edit their personal profile information and change passwords via the user profile module.",
    "Users switch between supported languages in the UI with dynamic translation and layout adjustments, including RTL for Arabic.",
    "Users toggle between dark and light themes, experiencing consistent UI style changes across all components."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Robust testing ensures no mock data is used; all modules connect to live backend services for integration validation.",
    "Landing page exhibits premium feel, multilingual support, animated glassmorphic backgrounds, and correct redirection workflows.",
    "User experience is seamless with smooth UI transitions, loading placeholders, and responsive design across devices."
