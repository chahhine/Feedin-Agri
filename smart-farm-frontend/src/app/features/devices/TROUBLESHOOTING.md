# Troubleshooting - No Visual Changes Showing

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache (MOST COMMON FIX)**

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"
- OR: Hard refresh with `Ctrl + F5`

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cache"
- Click "Clear Now"

### 2. **Restart Angular Dev Server**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl + C)
# Then restart:
cd smart-farm-frontend
npm start
# OR
ng serve
```

### 3. **Check for SCSS Compilation Errors**

Open your terminal where Angular is running and look for errors like:
```
Error: Can't find stylesheet to import
Error: Undefined variable
```

### 4. **Verify Files Are Saved**

Make sure all these files are saved:
- ✅ `devices.component.ts`
- ✅ `devices.component.html`
- ✅ `devices.component.scss`
- ✅ `_devices-header.scss`
- ✅ `_devices-filters.scss`
- ✅ `_devices-table.scss`
- ✅ `_devices-cards.scss`
- ✅ `_devices-shared.scss`
- ✅ `device.utils.ts`

## If Modular SCSS Files Don't Work

If Angular isn't compiling the modular SCSS files, I'll create a consolidated single-file version as a backup.

## Verification Checklist

After clearing cache and restarting:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Elements/Inspector tab**
3. **Find a device card or row**
4. **Check Computed Styles** - You should see:
   - `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
   - `animation` properties
   - Gradient backgrounds
   - Box shadows

5. **Check Console** - Should have NO errors

6. **Test Interactions:**
   - Hover over cards (should lift up)
   - Click refresh button (should spin)
   - Toggle view mode (should transition smoothly)
   - Watch loading state (should show skeleton loaders)

## Still Not Working?

If you still don't see changes, run this diagnostic:

```bash
# Check if SCSS files are being watched
ng serve --verbose
```

Look for lines mentioning the SCSS files being compiled.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Can't find stylesheet to import"
**Cause**: SCSS partials not in the right location
**Fix**: Ensure all `_devices-*.scss` files are in the same directory as `devices.component.scss`

### Issue: Styles not applying
**Cause**: ViewEncapsulation or cached styles
**Fix**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + F5)

### Issue: Console errors about missing functions
**Cause**: `device.utils.ts` not imported
**Fix**: Already done in `devices.component.ts` line 24

## Nuclear Option: Consolidated SCSS

If modular imports don't work, I'll provide a single consolidated `devices.component.scss` file with all styles in one place.
